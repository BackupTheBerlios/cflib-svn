purpose \- Purpose of CFLIB 
This library started as a Beginner Project in 'C Library Building' following practical needs arising from scientific/technical modeling projects\&.
.PP
Most of the library code has been created in 1994/95 on an Atari ST4/16 MHz under TOS 2\&.05/MiNT 1\&.12 with gcc 2\&.5\&.8 and the Mintlibs Patchlevel 46\&. The C coding is probably not the best possible ;-) but the source as well as the executable and allocated memory structures are very compact, simple to modify and still fine for many applications that need a stable, portable and small configuration interface\&.

\fB'Mission Statement' from 1994/95 README file:\fP
.RS 4
CFLIB is meant to be a flexible, sound and easy to use tool for C programmers\&. It provides a set of functions for a standard method for feeding a C program with all the (external) information it needs to perform as desired with a minimum of expense for both the programmer and the user: arguments, commands, program input, configurable and/or installation dependent features, system settings and a lot more can be passed to the program through different interfaces: command line, environment, configuration files or sections within them, interactive input and last but not least a built-in default\&. So it should be a fast and easy task for both the programmer and the user to build and change a configuration\&. The library will always take more space and perform slower than code that is written and optimized for a specific requirement, but this will only be a noticeable disadvantage in some cases\&. The library also provides some special features such as file search, time and date handling, generating simple, text template driven reports, etc\&. It is suitable for creating a comfortable and/or individual user interface for existing programs that don't have one\&. Some basic ideas for the library came from looking at the \fItermcap\fP library for easy and portable terminal I/O\&.
