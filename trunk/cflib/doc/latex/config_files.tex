A major task of the library is handling import and export of configuration parameters from/to files.

C\-F\-L\-I\-B knows two types of configuration files\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \char`\"{}\-Private Configuration File\char`\"{}} -\/ User and/or program specific file in simple format to be read on initialization and optionally be updated by \hyperlink{group__setting__saving_gaad7e1267cd904b4480a0eeaeb03b5f75}{cfsave()}
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \char`\"{}\-System Configuration File\char`\"{}} -\/ System and/or project specific file in extended format (supporting sections, see below) will only be used as a data source by \hyperlink{group__cflib__core_ga64fb341565c2ddfccd6669e5e6265a8a}{cfinit()} and will not be touched by \hyperlink{group__setting__saving_gaad7e1267cd904b4480a0eeaeb03b5f75}{cfsave()} unless you explicitly specify the filename.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{config_files_config_format}{}\subsection{Configuration File Format}\label{config_files_config_format}
In a configuration file lines beginning with {\ttfamily '\#'} are treated as comments and are ignored. Blank lines are ignored, too. A valid line in the file is of the form\-:

$<${\itshape name$>$\/} = $<${\itshape entry$>$\/} 

Blank chars around the {\ttfamily '='} are ignored. The name must match one of the entry's names in the initializer. In fact, any line not containing a {\ttfamily '='} will be ignored, but it's better to indicate comments with {\ttfamily '\#'!} 

The optional sections in the system configuration file begin with a line like\-:

\mbox{[}$<${\itshape sectionname$>$\/}\mbox{]}

and end with another line like this or with the file's last line. Anything after the closing bracket is ignored.

A simple example of a valid configuration file could look like this\-: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 # This is my private configuration file for Project 1356 Branch C in spe

 Search_Path  = /my/subproject/directory:/general/settings/directory
 Section      = project_1356
 Outfile      = my_subproject.cnf
 ask_if_empty =
 My_Flag =      ON
 VERBOSITY = 1
\end{DoxyCode}


The corresponding system configuration file could look like this\-: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 # This is a system wide configuration file
 [some_other_program]
 blah = blubber
 ...
 [project_1356]
 # Settings for Project 1356 Branch B
 VERBOSITY = 3
 Outfile = project_1356b.cnf
 X_EUR_USD=1.4562
 [some_other_project]
 ...
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{config_files_config_in}{}\subsection{Reading Configuration Files}\label{config_files_config_in}
A search for configuration files and import of data from these sources is only performed by the function \hyperlink{group__cflib__core_ga64fb341565c2ddfccd6669e5e6265a8a}{cfinit()} on initialization and only when appropriate Special Option Flags are set as described under \hyperlink{config_levels_config_file_parsing}{Parsing of Configuration Files}.

Configuration files are read once when the configuration database is initialized by a call to \hyperlink{group__cflib__core_ga64fb341565c2ddfccd6669e5e6265a8a}{cfinit()} or \hyperlink{group__cflib__core_ga6e04a462f9ad273de914af386ff15623}{cfstart()} using the internal function cfreadfile().\hypertarget{config_files_config_out}{}\subsection{Writing a (private) Configuration File}\label{config_files_config_out}
Parameter export does not depend on any specific setting and can be performed whenever and as often as you like. For writing a configuration file call \hyperlink{group__setting__saving_gaad7e1267cd904b4480a0eeaeb03b5f75}{cfsave()} with either the name of the file or {\ttfamily N\-U\-L\-L}, in which case the current value of the \char`\"{}\-Private Configuration File\char`\"{} parameter will be used, if it exists. If an entry has the \hyperlink{group__special__options__mask_gad76153c65f68cc0ee5c1a04c8c3e80bf}{C\-F\-\_\-\-N\-O\-S\-A\-V\-E} flag set, it is excluded from saving. The \char`\"{}\-System Configuration File\char`\"{} may not be referred to directly.

Writing {\bfseries section} marks is {\bfseries not} supported!
